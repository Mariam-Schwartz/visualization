# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Telecom Customers Churn Dashboard visualization by Iaroslava
      Visualization link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/iaroslava/viz/TelecomCustomersChurnDashboard/OVERVIEW
        To me this is an example of a good visualization because: 
    1. Aesthetic Appeal: The dashboard is visually engaging, which is a fundamental quality of good data visualization as outlined in the attachment. It balances color usage and spacing, making it visually pleasing without overwhelming the audience. Clear sectioning of charts and metrics ensures the dashboard doesn‚Äôt feel cluttered, even with multiple data points displayed.

    2. Effective Use of Chart Types: The document emphasizes the importance of familiar chart types to reduce cognitive load. This dashboard utilizes bar charts, line graphs, and other intuitive formats, ensuring the audience can interpret data efficiently. These visual elements align well with the content, such as churn rates and customer segmentation.

    3. Perceptual Clarity: The attachment highlights the importance of perceptual qualities, which are evident in the dashboard. The use of consistent fonts, clear labels, and concise legends ensures that viewers can easily extract insights. It also avoids extraneous cognitive load by presenting data in a way that is both accurate and accessible.

    4. Transparency and Credibility: The inclusion of data sources or legends signals transparency, a concept referred to as ‚Äúprovenance rhetoric‚Äù in the document. Such elements build trust in the visualization, making users more likely to engage with and believe the insights.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
        The visualization could be improved by: 
        1. Enhancing Accessibility: Use high-contrast colors and ensure all elements are legible across devices.
        2. Providing Narrative Guidance: Without adequate guidance or an introductory narrative, users might struggle to interpret key insights effectively. Including a short introductory section or annotations to guide users toward actionable insights.
        3. Focusing on Key Insights: Highlight top churn drivers or trends in a dedicated section to ensure these findings are not lost in the broader data

      Mobile-Optimized Superstore Sales Dashboard by Agata Ketterick
      Visualization link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/agata1619/viz/Mobile-OptimizedSuperstoreSalesDashboard/SalesSummary
        To me this is an example of a bad visualization because: 
    1. Lack of Clarity and Focus
        The dashboard fails to communicate its message effectively, which is a critical principle of good data visualization. A visualization should have a clear purpose, whether it is for persuasion, comparison, exploration, or evaluation. However, this dashboard does not adequately define or prioritize its objectives. The viewer is presented with multiple visual elements, but there is no clear hierarchy to guide attention to the most critical metrics. This lack of focus forces the user to expend unnecessary cognitive effort to understand the visualization.

    2.  High Cognitive Load
        The concept of cognitive load and distinguishes between intrinsic, germane, and extraneous cognitive load. In this dashboard, extraneous cognitive load is unnecessarily high due to a cluttered layout, excessive use of charts, and lack of concise labeling. This makes it difficult for viewers to process the information efficiently, especially on a mobile device.

    3.  Lack of Context
        The dashboard provides raw data but fails to contextualize it. For example, sales figures are displayed without benchmarks, targets, or historical comparisons, leaving the viewer without a clear understanding of whether the performance is good or bad. Providing context is essential for turning data into actionable insights.
        
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
        The visualization could be improved by: 
    1. Define the Purpose
    To improve this dashboard, the first step is to clarify its purpose. Is it intended to help managers evaluate overall performance, identify underperforming regions, or track specific categories? Once the purpose is defined, the design should focus on supporting that goal.

    2. Reduce Cognitive Load
    Reducing cognitive load requires simplifying the layout and minimizing unnecessary elements. Each chart or metric should have a clear reason for inclusion and should not overwhelm the viewer. Consolidate related metrics into a single chart where possible. For instance, combine sales and profit into a dual-axis chart to reduce the number of visuals while still showing their relationship. Add clear labels and titles to every chart, using concise language to explain what is being displayed.

    3. Add Contextual Information
    Providing context turns raw data into actionable insights. The dashboard should include benchmarks, comparisons, and narrative elements to guide interpretation. Add annotations or tooltips to explain key trends or anomalies, such as a sudden spike in sales for a specific category. Incorporate visual indicators like target lines or color-coded thresholds to show whether metrics are meeting expectations.



      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
